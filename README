Disclaimer
==========

This project is no longer maintained.
It uses symfony 1.4. I never upgraded this project to symfony 2.
Also note that it uses an old (very old) version of the facebook api, which is no longer supported by facebook.
Basically, it no longer works...


Intro
=====
This project is an idea of Hal Gatewood (http://www.halgatewood.com).
The idea is to build a website to let people write stories together.
Everybody who has a facebook account can start a story, write the first piece, and ask one of his/her facebook
